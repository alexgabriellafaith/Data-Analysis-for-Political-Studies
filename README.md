# Political Insights: Interactive Data Visualization for Students
As Politics and Data Science students at LSE, we struggle the politics related data being stored in ways which are hard to interpret such as regression tables or excel files, which makes finding data for essays a very tedious process. Therefore, we sought out a website that is a source of easy to interpret data, that can also be customised to create interactive correlation graphs with simple descriptions underneath the graphs themselves in the USA/UK/Global data portion of the website.

The descriptions help politics students, with no formal quatative skills, to make better anaylses for data summarisation. The data collected is political data focused on the USA, the UK, and global data to find more in depth sources to make graphs with interchangable variables.

## How to run the code in the notebooks:

Before running any notebooks ensure to install the requirements.txt file in terminal with following command: 

**pip install -r requirements.txt**

Then begin running notebooks as ordered, each should create a new csv file under the Data folder. The final notebook will create a database that will be used in order to create the website. Once the database is created, you can access the website by running the following common in terminal: streamlit run webstream.py.
