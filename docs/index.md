## Why we chose our project topic ðŸ‘€:
As Politics and Data Science students at LSE, we struggle with the abundance of data on the internet, but that data being complex, not customisable to fit our needs, and in general, too difficult to find. Therefore, we sought out a website to find easily sourced data, that can also be customised to create interactive correlation graphs with simple descriptions underneath the graphs themselves in the USA/UK/Global data portion of the website. 

We find it difficult to summarize graphs, with no prior education in the manner, and so the descriptions aim to help politics students, like us make better anaylses for data summarisation. The data collected is political data in ehich we most frequently use, and we narrowed our focus to the USA, the UK, and global data to find more in depth sources to make graphs with interchangable variables. 

## How we gathered our data and challenges we faced:
We utilised the following methods to gather data throughout the project:

### Method 1: Web Scraping ðŸ’»
We gathered the majority of our data from different sources through web scraping. There were an abundance of tables and undesired data in each link, so we started by choosing the table we wanted to scrape, and did so by using different commands such as pandas and scrapy. We utilised credible sources such as census.gov and governmental data, but we also used other sources where we found that the data was easier to scrape, and variables that were not changed according to the credibility of the source, such as land area. Some issues we had with web scraping were the fact that it was difficult finding scrapable data for the graphs we wanted to produce, and therefore could not collect as much data as we wanted to via this method.
